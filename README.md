# EmoPair Dataset: Deep dive into emotional and stress responses of people ü´Ä

Physiological signals provide critical insights into emotional and stress responses, essential for applications in health monitoring and mental health treatment. The ‚ÄùEmoPairCompete‚Äù dataset,
introduced by Das et al. (2024), offers a unique perspective on emotion and frustration assessment under team and competitive behaviors. This dataset not only captures physiological
signals such as heart rate, electrodermal activity, and temperature but also correlates these signals
with self-reported emotional states, providing a comprehensive resource for studying physiological
responses in semi-controlled setting

This project leverages the dataset to explore whether physiological responses, as
grouped by clustering techniques, exhibit consistency across different participants when exposed to
the same experimental conditions. Specifically, it asks: *‚ÄùTo what extent do participants with similar
biosignals transition across the experimental phases together, suggesting a common physiological
reaction to the experimental conditions?‚Äù*
